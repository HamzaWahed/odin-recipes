    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        One of Malaysia's well known dishes is beef rendang, a slow cooked
        dry curry deeply spliced with ginger and tumeric, kaffir lime and chilis.
        In Malaysian fashion, it fuses sweet, sour, and savory elements, the curry
        picking up a creamy richness from two forms of coconut and an elusive
        tang from asam keping, slices of sour sun-dried fruit.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup grated coconut</li>
        <li>15 dried chiles</li>
        <li>10 shallots, sliced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
        <li>1 inch ginger (20g), sliced</li>
        <li>1 inch galangal (20g), sliced</li>
        <li>1 inch tumeric (10g), sliced</li>
        <li>2 stalks lemongrass, sliced</li>
        <li>4 to 6 bird chiles, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place coconut in wok over medium heat and dry-fry until golden brown. 
            Cool slightly before grinding finely in mortar and pestle, or in food processor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Snip chiles into 1-inch lengths. Soak in hot water until softened. 
            Discard half the seeds and place the chiles in electric blender jug with shallots, garlic, 
            ginger, galangal, turmeric and lemongrass. If you want a hotter rendang, add bird chiles. 
            Add 1/2 cup water and grind to a paste- but not too finely.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place spice paste, beef, coconut milk, and water in a roomy wok. 
            Bring to a boil and simmer on medium heat, stirring now and then until mixture is well 
            reduced and thick and oil surfacesâ€”at least 45 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add ground toasted coconut, turmeric leaf (if using), makrut lime leaf, salt, sugar, 
            and asam keping (if using). Cook another 5-10 minutes, taste, and adjust seasonings if necessary. 
            Take pan off heat. Serve with rice.
        </li>
    </ol>
